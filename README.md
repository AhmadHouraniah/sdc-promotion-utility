# SDC Promotion Utility

## 🎯 Purpose

This Python utility automates the promotion of **IP-level SDC constraints** to **top-level designs** in complex SoC and FPGA projects.

When integrating multiple IP blocks into a top-level design, each IP comes with its own SDC constraints. This tool automatically:

- 🔗 **Maps IP-level ports** to their corresponding top-level signals  
- 🧩 **Expands vector signals** to bit-level constraints  
- 🎛️ **Promotes all constraint types**: clocks, I/O delays, false paths, transitions, multicycle paths  
- 🔀 **Merges multiple IP SDCs** into a unified top-level SDC  
- ✨ **Removes duplicates** and resolves conflicts automatically  
- 🎯 **Filters constraints** based on signal connectivity to top-level I/O
- 📋 **Integrates with existing** top-level SDC files

---

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-IP Support**: Process multiple IPs in a single run
- **Vector Signal Handling**: Automatic expansion of bus signals to individual bits
- **Wildcard Support**: Handles `signal[*]` patterns in constraints
- **Intelligent Deduplication**: Removes duplicate constraints while preserving intent

### Enhanced Features
- **Signal Connectivity Analysis**: Only promotes I/O delays for signals connected to top-level ports
- **Initial SDC Integration**: Merges with existing top-level constraints (initial SDC takes precedence)
- **Ignored Constraints Tracking**: Saves non-promoted constraints to separate files for debugging
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically resolves constraint conflicts by choosing appropriate values

### Supported SDC Constructs
- `create_clock` / `create_generated_clock`
- `set_input_delay` / `set_output_delay` (with -max/-min)
- `set_max_transition` / `set_max_delay` / `set_min_delay`
- `set_false_path` / `set_multicycle_path`
- `set_clock_groups`

## 🧪 Test Cases

The repository includes comprehensive test cases demonstrating various scenarios:

| Test | Description | Features Demonstrated |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **test1** | Basic single IP | Simple port mapping, basic constraints |

## 📊 Results Comparison

The enhanced version (test6) demonstrates significant improvements over the original approach:

- **Constraint Reduction**: ~45% fewer constraints in final SDC
- **Improved Accuracy**: Only promotes constraints for connected signals
- **Better Debugging**: Separate files for ignored constraints
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent merging with existing constraints

## 📋 Example Workflow

1. **Prepare IP constraints**: Each IP has its own `.sdc` file
2. **Create top-level design**: Instantiate IPs with proper signal connections
3. **Run promotion**: Use the utility to generate top-level SDC
4. **Review results**: Check promoted constraints and ignored files
5. **Integrate with EDA flow**: Use generated SDC in synthesis/P&R

### Before (Manual Process)
- ❌ Manual port mapping for each IP
- ❌ Error-prone constraint translation
- ❌ Difficult maintenance across design changes
- ❌ No automated conflict detection

### After (Automated Process)  
- ✅ Automatic signal mapping and promotion
- ✅ Intelligent constraint filtering
- ✅ Built-in conflict resolution
- ✅ Easy integration with existing flows
